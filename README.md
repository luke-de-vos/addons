# addons
Local addons for Garry's Mod: TTT2.

Functions that begin with an underscore are defined in aa_global_funcs.


### FIXES

- aa_global_funcs: vector normalization for propulsion should not necessarily result in a max value of 1. Normalizing like that will make propulsion in ordinal directions stronger than cardinal directions.
    
### IDEAS
- glue trap
    - roots player for a few seconds
    - visible?
    - can be jumped over
    - T can use it to clog bottlenecks to get away or to group enemies for damage
- model copier
    - T targets player. T will inherit target's playermodel when T next hits some special key.
    - once target is set, model is swapped back and forth each time T crouches
- gold deag
    - spawn only once. spawn on random other weapon spawn
    - change equip slot to pistol instead of special
    - change to golden club or something? Something slow and close range so it's hard to use in combat
    - make it a regular club we call "the sheriff" lol
- dropped weapon projectile damage
     - weapon dropped by player may collide with other player and deal low damage
     - allow player to "throw" weapon
    
### MISC
- proximity chat
    - test TTT2's first
