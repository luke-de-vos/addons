# addons
Local addons for Garry's Mod: TTT2.

Functions that begin with an underscore are defined in aa_global_funcs.


### TODO

- Prop Siccer: should only target innos. Avoid jester etc
- Barrel Wand: special barrel is broken. next_barrel_hot bool is shared between players
- aa_global_funcs: vector normalization for propulsion should not necessarily result in a max value of 1. Normalizing like that will make propulsion in ordinal directions stronger than cardinal directions.
