# addons
Local addons for Garry's Mod: TTT2.

Functions that begin with an underscore are defined in aa_global_funcs.


### TODO

- Prop Siccer: should only target innos. Avoid jester etc
- Barrel Wand: right click parry?
- aa_global_funcs: vector normalization for propulsion should not necessarily result in a max value of 1. Normalizing like that will make propulsion in ordinal directions stronger than cardinal directions.
- switch golden deag to pistol slot
    - need to download and extract first
    
### IDEAS
- glue trap
    - roots player for a few seconds
    - visible?
    - can be jumped over
    - T can use it to clog bottlenecks to get away or to group enemies for damage
- model copier
    - T targets player. T will inherit target's playermodel when T next hits some special key.
    - once target is set, do not require specific equip to take model
